   <p style="background-color:rgb(231, 109, 109);">For a memorable meal the quality of the service is something that guests often remember as much as the food and drink served.

    That means that restaurant servers must show extensive knowledge of all types of cuisine and dishes, especially the ingredients and cooking style of the dishes on an a la carte menu. They will need to know and understand the methods of preparation and serving, along with the tools used.
    
    Regardless of whether it is a self-service cafeteria or a five star hotel restaurant good manners, a smart appearance, and impeccable personal hygiene are equally essential.</p>

One of the most famous contemporary guides is the Michelin series of guides which accord from 1 to 3 stars to restaurants they perceive to be of high culinary merit. Restaurants with stars in the Michelin guide are formal, expensive establishments; in general the more stars awarded, the higher the prices.

        The main competitor to the Michelin guide in Europe is the guidebook series published by Gault Millau. Its ratings are on a scale of 1 to 20, with 20 being the highest.
        
        
        Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, New York has two Michelin stars
        In the United States, the Forbes Travel Guide (previously the Mobil travel guides) and the AAA rate restaurants on a similar 1 to 5 star (Forbes) or diamond (AAA) scale. Three, four, and five star/diamond ratings are roughly equivalent to the Michelin one, two, and three star ratings while one and two star ratings typically indicate more casual places to eat. In 2005, Michelin released a New York City guide, its first for the United States.<br> popular Zagat Survey compiles individuals' comments about restaurants but does not pass an "official" critical assessment.
    
        
        Nearly all major American newspapers employ food critics and publish online dining guides for the cities they serve. Some news sources provide customary reviews of restaurants, while others may provide more of a general listings service.
        
        More recently Internet sites have started up that publish both food critic reviews and popular reviews by the general public.</p>
        <p style="background-color:rgb(233, 109, 109);font-family:sans-serif;">As of 2006, there are approximately 215,000 full-service restaurants in the United States, accounting for $298 billion in sales, and approximately 250,000 limited-service (fast food) restaurants, accounting for $260 billion.[53] Starting in 2016, Americans spent more on restaurants than groceries.[54] In October 2017, The New York Times reported there are 620,000 eating and drinking places in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. They also reported that the number of restaurants are growing almost twice as fast as the population.[55]

            One study of new restaurants in Cleveland, Ohio found that 1 in 4 changed ownership or went out of business after one year, and 6 out of 10 did so after three years. (Not all changes in ownership are indicative of financial failure.)[56] The three-year failure rate for franchises was nearly the same.[57]
            
            Restaurants employed 912,100 cooks in 2013, earning an average $9.83 per hour.[58] The waiting staff numbered 4,438,100 in 2012, earning an average $8.84 per hour.[59] <br>
            
            Jiaxi Lu of the Washington Post reports in 2014 that, "Americans are spending $683.4 billion a year dining out, and they are also demanding better food quality and greater variety from restaurants to make sure their money is well spent."[60]
